# SIMULATION OF PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION OF TRACK TYPE TRACTOR ON SOIL


Based on the contact problem of the theory of elasticity, the authors developed a pressure distribution model under the support part of a track mover, taking into account the influence of the geometry and design parameters of a track mover, the location of the center of mass, the magnitude and the point of application of draught resistance acting on a tractor. And this mathematical model considers soil parameters, includes the description of boundary conditions and a correction factor. The created mathematical model and program provide a high calculation speed, reliability, and accuracy of the results, which is confirmed by experimental data.

The main advantages of the created software: reliability, accuracy and functionality sufficient for implementation of current and prospective experimental design work.
Thus, a mathematical model and software in the C# language have been developed, which allow modeling the distribution of pressure of propellers on the soil with various input indicators. The adequacy of the model and the simulation program was checked, and a correction factor was introduced into the model. Checking the adequacy of the model and program showed the convergence of the calculated and experimental data.
